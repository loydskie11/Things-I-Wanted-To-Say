Like I always say, be gentle with yourself. Let rest cradle you now and then, and wander from your burdens when the weight feels too much.

It's okay not to be okay. Life is a roller coaster ride, and bad days are temporary. Please don't be discouraged when life gets rough. You've always got it, Alli. 

I like your brown eyes, your smile, the way you smile, your tiny dimples, your eye bags, your voice, your face when you frown, your hair, your tiny bangs, everything, even if you hate it, i like it.

I know you already carry this truth in your heart, but if ever the loneliness creeps in, just remember—God is always with you, holding you through it all.

Capture every moment and hold it close—document the little things, the quiet days, the loud laughs. One day, when nostalgia knocks, you’ll have pieces of your past to look back on, like soft echoes frozen in time.

To Alli, who finds comfort in the quiet pages—may you always discover a little magic in every chapter, and may the stories you hold close remind you that your own is still unfolding beautifully.

I praying that you'll be successful in life, not just financially, but  emotionally, and mentally too. In God's name.

Take every opportunity that feels right for you. It might be risky, but it's in the leap—and in the landing—that you’ll shape who you’re meant to be.

You have a kind, pure soul—don’t let the world make you feel like that’s anything less than a strength.

You’ve inspired me to grow, to do better, and to become a better version of myself.

Self-doubt may whisper you're not enough, but remember—you’ve overcome every hard day so far. You’re capable, you’re growing, and you’re more than what your fears say.

You’re the author of your life—write it boldly. Do what sets your soul on fire, and choose the path that makes you truly happy.

I’m not the best at expressing my thoughts and feelings, so I created this website as my way of saying what words sometimes can't.

I hope this brings you even the slightest bit of joy—just enough to brighten your day.

When was the last time you felt at peace, even for a moment—like the world slowed down just enough for you to breathe and simply be?

-------------------------------------
You're safe, Alli. It's only your thoughts getting loud again. You'll make it through. //

Forgive yourself, Alli, not because you never made mistakes but because you are still growing and learning every day. //

Be patient with yourself. Growth takes time, and so do the best things in life. //

You don't have to explain the fences you build to protect your peace.

Celebrate small wins, they're proof you're moving forward, even if it's one quiet step at a time. //

You don't have to have it all figured out, Alli. Just remind yourself to keep going. :> //

One breath. One task. One moment. That's all you need to focus on right now. //

You are enough, always has been, even on the days you doubted it. //

You are not alone, Alli. Even in silence, someone is thinking of you. 

Let it out, then let it go. Peace is not weakness, it's strength in quiet form. //

I like you — enough that I’d be okay with you ghosting me every time exams come around, even if it means being on the sidelines while you stress and focus. I’d still choose you, even in the silence.

Live the kind of life that makes your heart feel full — laugh loudly, love deeply, and never hold back from chasing what makes your soul feel alive.

Please be careful and avoid eating any foods you’re allergic to, we just don’t want you going through anything painful or risky because of something that could’ve been avoided.

Please take it easy, Alli. You're doing great. Just like the sunrise, each day gives you a fresh start. And like the sunset, it's okay to rest because even endings can be beautiful.

There are nights the sky feels heavy, but still, the stars appear — distant, quiet, yet faithful. Like them, you don’t have to be loud to be strong. Your light, though soft, still reaches someone’s darkness.

I saw an Instagram post that said April 23 is 'Books and Roses' Day, where people give books and roses to book lovers. So this serves as my 'Books and Roses' present for you.

Like a koi in rushing waters, you keep moving forward — not because it’s easy, but because there’s strength in your spirit. Resilience isn’t about never falling, but about rising with grace, no matter how strong the current.

I want to be closer to your fire, not to extinguish or to control it, I just need to be near to it.

I don’t want to extinguish your fire, nor do I wish to control it. I only long to be near it — to stand close enough to feel its warmth, to witness its glow, and to quietly admire the way it lights up everything around it, including me.

This might be a selfish thing to say. I hope I'm not confusing you with everything I’ve been doing — it’s just that I like you a lot, and I always will... until the day the sunsets no longer move me, and the songs we shared fade from memory.

Walk your path without asking for permission. Shine in ways only you can. You are your own masterpiece, and you owe it to yourself to live boldly, not quietly. You do you, Alli.

----------------------------------------
I hope you heal from the things you don’t talk about, Alli. I hope you win your silent battles. Always remember that you’re not alone, and God is always with you.

I admire your mindset and values. The way you stay true to yourself, make thoughtful choices, and lead with kindness is truly inspiring.

I'm sorry if I took too long to reply, and sometimes (maybe almost every time?) I left you on seen. It's not that I don't want to talk, I just don’t always know how to start or what to say. I often get stuck between trying to keep the conversation going or not wanting to come off as awkward. But I’m building up my courage, little by little, because you matter to me and I want to do better. :>>

I'm grateful our paths have intertwined — a meeting I’ll always treasure. The moments we shared still linger in my heart, and each memory whispers how deeply I’ve come to cherish you.

There's nothing here, just wanted to say you're so kind and gorgeous.

I truly admire your dedication and the way you put your heart into everything you do. Your kindness and strong faith are truly inspiring.

These five gerbera flowers are my gift to you this May 15, Bring Flowers to Someone Day. I saw you talking about these flowers in your Instagram notes, so I got really curious about them. ^^
