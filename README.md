# Things I Wanted To Say
This project is a graduation gift for my pretty crush, and also serves as my practice in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
## Features
1. Floating emojis that displays a corresponding note/quote when clicked.
2. A shuffle button that shuffles emojis positions using JavaScript.
3. A song player that play or pause a song.
